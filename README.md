# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors
---
This project aims to showcase what I have learned about Javascript through the introductory course on [The Odin Project's website](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

In this section, I learned more about the foundations of Javascript and basics of problem solving. The most helpful piece of information was the process of solving a problem. Many times I would hop right into a project without proper planning beforehand. I learned to ask what the project is, the inputs I should be looking for, the output that I want to achieve, and then given the inputs how to achieve the output.
